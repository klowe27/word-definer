# Word Definer

#### Ruby Word Definer, 11.30.18

#### By Kristin Brewer-Lowe

## Description

This basic application is a word definer for kids. The user can create a list of words they don't know (but would like to learn) and then come up with their own definitions. The homepage lets a user add to a list. When a word in the list is clicked, it takes the user to a page for that word; the user can add as many definitions as they'd like or delete the word entry. The user can also view all words (including definitions), go to a random word, and sort their list of words in alphabetical order.
