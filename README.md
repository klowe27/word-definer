# Word Definer

#### Ruby Word Definer, 11.30.18

#### By Kristin Brewer-Lowe

## Description

This basic application is a word definer for kids. Kids can create a list of words they don't know (but would like to learn) and then come up with their own definitions. The homepage of the site lists all the words and allows kids to add additional words. When a word is clicked, it takes the user to a page with its definitions; the user can add additional definitions.
